	The following code runs a web page that simulates a firehouse having to deal with various emergencies popping up all over a city.  The user's job is to dispatch trucks to the emergencies so that they will be resolved and the city can be safe.

	Throughout the code there are numerous comments, QUESTIONS, and ACTIVITIES.  Read the code and complete the QUESTIONS and ACTIVITIES.  For many of the QUESTIONS, there is no single right answer.  Use your best judgment and formulate a hypothesis or opinion.
